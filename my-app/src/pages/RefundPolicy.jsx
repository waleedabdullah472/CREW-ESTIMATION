      <h2>Things to Note Down Before Placing an Order</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to our terms of service when you accept our estimate or pay
        the fee of your order.
      </p>

      <h2>What is CREW ESTIMATION Cost of Service?</h2>
      <p>
        Our CREW ESTIMATION fees may change with the type of project. The total cost
        of our service is calculated on the basis of specifications and time
        required. You’ll get an initial quote on the basis of drawings, plans,
        and tender documents.
      </p>

      <h2>What are Our Payment Terms and Policy?</h2>
      <p>
        We will proceed to work after the verification of the payment. Plus, we
        will start the work the next day if we receive payment after 2 PM EST.
      </p>

      <h2>Non-Refundable Services</h2>
      <p>
        Certain services such as consultation fees and customized solutions are
        strictly non-refundable.
      </p>

      <h2>Processing of Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Approved refunds will be processed within 7–10 business days and will be
        credited to the original payment method.
      </p>

      <h2>Partial Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        In cases where only part of the service has been delivered, a partial
        refund may be considered at our discretion.
      </p>

      <h2>Client Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        We will deliver the requirement on the agreed due date. However, it is
        hard to determine the exact time due to complexity. That’s why our
        delivery can become a little late. In case, if you require us to deliver
        before a date, then you should notify us at the time of order.
        <br />
        <br />
        We will provide you with periodic updates, and you can contact us for
        the status of your order.
        <br />
        <br />
        We will start your work the next day if you pay us after 2 PM EST. Plus,
        if your delivery falls on Saturday or Sunday, then we will deliver the
        requirement on Monday. We will deliver your requirement on the next
        business day if there is a national holiday.
      </p>

      <h2>What is Our Refund Policy?</h2>
      <p>
        We will do unlimited revisions for you if you are not satisfied with the
        delivery of your order. Plus, we will do your work until your issue is
        resolved. We do not refund the payment after we have started work on
        your requirement.
        <br />
        <br />
        We provide detailed and accurate work. It happens that we do some
        mistakes due to human conditions. For that, we will comply with your
        demand and remove all errors from the delivery. But we will not refund
        your payment after we have delivered your order.
        <br />
        <br />
        When you pay us, you accept our terms of the refund policy. Plus, our
        refund policy does not change in any case. So, place your order while
        considering our refund policy as the foundation stone of our commitment.
      </p>

      <h2>What is Our Revision Policy?</h2>
      <p>
        We do estimates and take-offs based on the drawings and plans provided
        by the client. If there is a human error, then we will revise our
        estimates as required by the client. However, if you require us to
        deliver new estimates, then there will be a cost. We can give you a
        discount, but you have to pay us for the next order on the same
        drawings.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        All rates and prices of material/labour are calculated on the basis of
        average price/rates in the USA. If you want the exact figures, then you
        have to provide us with rates of labour and prices of material items.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our estimates can vary from actual rates and prices. Thus, you have to
        accept our estimates on the provided values.
