        <h2>Cost Estimation</h2>
        <p>
        CREW ESTIMATION offers a wide range of construction cost
         estimating services and cost management services to cater to the
          needs of the ever-growing construction industry.

Construction cost estimating is the process of forecasting the cost of 
building a physical structure. Of course, builders and clients both worry

 about the financial impact of cost overruns and failing to complete a project.

Clients considering large projects often seek multiple cost estimates, 
including those prepared by contractors and those calculated by independent estimators.

Project owners use cost estimates to determine a projectâ€™s scope and 

feasibility and to allocate budgets. Contractors use them when deciding
 whether to bid on a project. You usually prepare estimates with the input 
 of architects and engineers to ensure that a project meets financial feasibility 
 and scope requirements.

A good cost estimate prevents the builder from losing money and helps the 
customer avoid overpaying.

        <h2>Different Types of Construction Cost Estimates we offer</h2>
        <p>
         Cost estimates are broken down into three categories that serve one of 

         three basic functions: design, bid, and control. To establish a projectâ€™s
          financing, you must start with a design estimate or a bid estimate.
        </p>
        <h3>1. DESIGN ESTIMATES</h3>
        <p>
 Design estimates include screening (order of magnitude) estimates, preliminary 
 (conceptual) estimates, detailed (definitive) estimates, and engineerâ€™s estimates. 
 These estimates run parallel with the planning and design of a project.<br></br>
<p>â€¢ Design Estimates</p>
<p>â€¢ Screening estimates</p>
<p></p>â€¢ Engineerâ€™s estimates (based on specifications and <p>architectural plans).</p>
<p>â€¢ Preliminary cost estimates</p>
        </p>
         <h3>2. BID ESTIMATES</h3>
         <p>Bid estimates are submitted to the investor for purposes of competitive
           bidding or general negotiation. These estimates consider the direct construction 
           cost including field supervision, as well as a markup to cover general overhead 
           and profits. Direct construction costs include subcontractor quotations, 
           quantity takeoffs, and construction procedures.</p>
        <h3>3. CONTROL ESTIMATES:</h3>
        <p>Control estimates are used throughout a project to monitor costs. 
          A control estimate establishes the budget estimate for financing, 
          the budgeted cost before construction, and the estimated cost of 
          completion during an ongoing project.</p>
          <p>â€¢ Budget cost estimate for financing purposes.</p>
          <p>â€¢ Budgeted cost after assigning to contractor but before construction.</p>
          <p>â€¢ Estimated cost of completion during ongoing construction.</p>
